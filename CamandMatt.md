#Midterm Presentation
#6/15/2015

No talk about what your project is, you keep talking about refactoring...it makes no sense.
A presentation that is demo starts with what your project IS...
The title is not even fully shown, it just says SHOULD...where is the I?
Did you guys test this before showing us? Apparently not.
This was a bad presnetation overall because it was unclear what you did for a long time until Joe asked the question.
