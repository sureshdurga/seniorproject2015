Crappy proposal as usual

Timeline:
Absolutely no plans....apparently they are agile....whatever

POA:
Refactored node SDK
- arewegood v1 node sdk did a poor job at establishing secure, realtime connections to the
service
- arewegood v1 node sdk did not follow common node error handling practices

This is what they are going to work this week.
Trevor will work on the UI
