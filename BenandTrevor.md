Trevor will work on the UI
Ben will work on the refractoring.

Last Sprint:
Nodesdk v0.1.0 is nearly done, uses node error handling practices, fully tested, code coverage, etc. Really awesome work here.
UI is up and running, but needs more polish, and focus on UX. Good work, but will need more moving forward.

## POA:
Add polish to UI, begin spec-ing out new features
Work on c# sdk, begin spec-ing out new c# sdk features

## This is what they are going to work on this week:
Trevor will continue to work on the UI.
