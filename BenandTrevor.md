Proposal:
Crappy proposal as usual
No timeline indicated.
3/10

Timeline:
Absolutely no plans....apparently they are agile....whatever

POA:
Refactored node SDK
- arewegood v1 node sdk did a poor job at establishing secure, realtime connections to the
service
- arewegood v1 node sdk did not follow common node error handling practices

This is what they are going to work this week.
Trevor will work on the UI
Ben will work on the refractoring.

# 5/20/2015

Last Sprint:
Nodesdk v0.1.0 is nearly done, uses node error handling practices, fully tested, code coverage, etc. Really awesome work here.
UI is up and running, but needs more polish, and focus on UX. Good work, but will need more moving forward.

## POA:
Add polish to UI, begin spec-ing out new features
Work on c# sdk, begin spec-ing out new c# sdk features

## This is what they are going to work on this week:
Trevor will continue to work on the UI.
Ben will focus on new features and c# sdk.

#Midterm Presentation

I like how clean the interface looks. 
Trevor is wearing a FB T-shirt, this is NOT business casual.
The demo itself was not well thought through, you know what you are talking about, but you need to make it interesting to your audience.
This is a great tool for developers, you need to et your sales pitch right.
