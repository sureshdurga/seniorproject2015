Not bad at all guys, the miscis is horrible but this looks like the basics are done. 
I am not able to understand the beat because you did not explain your project in the beginning.
You need to get yur slaes pitch for the project right. The animations work and that is more important rather than them being static.
Based on what you have shown today I have hope that the game will be functional, #A-
